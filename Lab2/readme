I was in the wrong direction for the ES so I asked paul-raphael, what should I make evolutionari in this lab.
So here the answer is to choose which strategy to use each turn with a weigth system
I ultimatly used his code and try tweaking it

the result tend to sometimes not really avantage optimal strategy and disavantage pure_random, But gabriella is also sometimes in the middle
maybe it is due to too much mutation probability

In a way, using ea in this way is not efficient to make the ultimate strategie, but it can be used to make different difficulty
lvl for an ordi opponent. The tweak of buffing or debuffing can be made by ea instead of doing it by hand.
